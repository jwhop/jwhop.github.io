description: Passage is a full-transformation DOOM mode involving an original alternate-control mechanism. The game features the player walking around in a Target retail store with nothing but a tape recorderto interact with the deer roaming around the store. Technically, the project uses a repurposed cassette recorder as well as an Arduino Uno and a Processing Program to simulate different keypresses. The cassette also maintains its motor functions!
