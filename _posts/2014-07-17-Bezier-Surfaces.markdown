description: Project implements BÃ¨zier surfaces in Pico-8 using Lua. Project uses a version of de Casteljau's algorithm to display 3D objects. For input, the original data set for the Utah teapot was used, with the implementation breaking down the different patches and displaying each. Credit to Noah Rosamilla's 3D projection algorithm as used in the Picozine #2. Related Media - <a href="https://twitter.com/jwhopkin/status/1138294563376730112">Tweet</a>
