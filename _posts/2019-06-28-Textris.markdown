description: This Discord bot implementation of Tetris has a catch the pieces fall very, very slowly. Work together as a server to keep the game from overflowing! Credit to @Sam_c_lee for the original tetris implementation. My roles in this group project included concept, bot creation and server-side implementation, and improvements to Tetris code.
