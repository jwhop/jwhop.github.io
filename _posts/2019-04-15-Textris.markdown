description: This game made as a Discord bot is a standard implementation of Tetris, with one catch: the pieces fall very, very slowly. The goal of the game is to have an entire server work together in keeping the tetris game from topping out, resulting in a loss. Project is passed its alpha phase and is scheduled to be released for any discord server in mid July 2019. Bot was originally constructed as a group project. Credit to Sam Lee for the original Tetris JavaScript implementation! My role included project concept, constructing the bot, doing server-side work, and making improvements to the Tetris code.
