Thanks for checking out my website! I'm Jonny, I like making games and playful art. I really enjoy the physicality of games and input, as well as the social play that emerges in games. Currently, I'm thinking about animals playing sports, plunderludics, boshi's place, and weird ways to use a computer mouse. When I'm not making stuff, you can find me running, climbing, baking fruit pies, watching movies, or playing games (Blood on the Clocktower and Deadlock are my favorites right now:^) Resume here\nCV here\nTeaching Portfolio here\nPraise ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/","section":"Everything","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":" Simple, yet powerful.
