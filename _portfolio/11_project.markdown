For the final project in my modeling class, I decided to model one of the Guardians from the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I learned a lot about modeling in the process, as the project really helped combine different elements of other projects and lab activities in the class. Stay tuned for a turntable and better render images!
