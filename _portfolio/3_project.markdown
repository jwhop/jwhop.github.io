The final project for my TCS 198: Modding class, "Passage" is a complete transformation of the 1993 PC game "DOOM". The game features an original controller, textures, and sprites. The game features the player walking around in a Target retail store with nothing but a tape recorder interacting with the deer roaming around the store. My inspiration with this project was taking a completely human-made space and having the player passively listen to the nature that has taken over it. As an addition to the game I have re-purposed a cassette recorder to act as the controller for the game, using an Arduino Uno chip and Processing program to simulate different key-presses and mouse commands used within the game. The cassette also maintained its functional motor and changes depending on which button the player presses. 

Credit Note: While the deer sprites are heavily edited and include some original alterations of it, I did not create the initial sprite used to make the other angles and frames of its animation. Additionally, I do not own the rights for the music used in the game.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="Passage1.jpg">
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
