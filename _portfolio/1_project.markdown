Look Up is a work in progress virtual reality art game developed for my class meditating on performance and embodiment in media. The game involves the player wandering through different environments in effort to look at the moon. Upon looking up and "winning the level", the player finds themself in a different environment from where they were.

	The first level finds the player in a desert with a dune in front of them, obscuring the moon. The player must climb the dune and look up to advance to the next level, a city balcony.

Note: gameplay footage acquired using first person controller in unity for simplicity and proof of concept, VR footage will be posted when I return to the lab!

As of April 2018, this game is still in progress. However, it did inspire my final project which can be accessed on my portfolio link.
