Completed as a group assignment for my Game Platforms class, Vinecent Van Gato is a platformer where you play as a cat climbing trees. My responsibilities for this project included all of the programming.

NOTE: Both the cat animation used in the introduction as well as the moving background in the game can be attributed to <a href="https://twitter.com/2DArray"> 2D Array </a> on Twitter. The background sketch was heavily modified, but our team wanted to give credit to the original artist.
