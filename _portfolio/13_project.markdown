For the final project in my virtual reality class that explored virtuality and performativity from the media theory perspective, I developed A Walk in the Park, an interactive Virtual Reality installation. The installation features a picnic blanket and pillow present in both the physical space of the installation and the virtual space of the piece. The piece involves the user walking around a forest of trees. When the player stays on the picnic blanket, the trees start to change color rapidly, but when they are off the blanket they change color at a slower pace. A detailed description of the piece and its inspirations can be found below in the accompanying talk to the piece.
