This work is a fully rigged character model made for the UC Davis Motion Capture Lab! This model has fully functional viseme blendshapes as well as a skeletal rig. 

More pictures to be uploaded soon! (Note: as of Nov. 2018, the character files are on an external hard drive. I currently do not have a computer capable of rendering the model more extensively, but more pictures will be uploaded when available.)
