This work is an in progress model I have been making for my internship with the UC Davis Motion Capture Lab. The model is original and uses a working skeleton provided by the motion capture lab. Further along in the project I will be binding the skeleton to the mesh and providing blendshape animations for facial expressions and mouth positions.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/Character1.png" alt="" title="Screenshot 1"/>
	<img class="col two" src="/img/Character2.png" alt="" title="Screenshot 2"/>
	
	
</div>
